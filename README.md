# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Project Overview

While a significant amount of research has been dedicated to detecting fraud in credit card transactions and insurance claims, there is comparatively less focus on identifying identity fraud during the credit card application process. Identity fraud occurs when individuals use stolen or fabricated personal information to apply for credit cards, leading to financial loss for institutions and damage to victimsâ€™ credit profiles.

This project aims to address this gap by developing a machine learning model capable of detecting identity fraud in credit card applications. Using real or synthetic datasets, the model will learn to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent applications based on various applicant features and behavioral patterns.

The project involves:

-Data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical variables

-Feature selection and engineering to identify the most relevant predictors

-Model training using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting

-Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust fraud detection performance

By implementing this model, we aim to provide an effective and automated solution that helps financial institutions minimize risk, reduce losses, and strengthen the integrity of their credit approval processes.
